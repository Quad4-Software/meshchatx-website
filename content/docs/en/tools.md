The **Tools** page groups mesh diagnostics and helper apps. Each tool opens its own view with a back link to the grid.

## Network diagnostics

| Tool               | Purpose                                            |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Ping               | Measure round-trip time to a reachable destination |
| RNProbe            | Probe whether a destination answers                |
| RNPath             | Inspect the path table                             |
| RNPath-trace       | Trace hops toward a destination                    |
| RNStatus           | Read node status information                       |
| Network visualiser | Graph view of topology (also in main navigation)   |

Use these when messages or pages fail despite interfaces showing as enabled.

## File transfer and shell

| Tool         | Purpose                                                  |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| RNCP         | Send or fetch files over Reticulum                       |
| RNS FileSync | Sync a directory with peers over rns_filesync.filesync |
| RNSH         | Remote shell sessions with streamed output               |

RNCP progress events arrive on the WebSocket as rncp.transfer.progress.
FileSync progress and peer events use filesync.sync.progress, filesync.peer.connected, filesync.peer.disconnected, filesync.file.updated, filesync.file.deleted, and filesync.error.
FileSync uses the bundled rns_filesync package and keeps sync state under the active identity storage directory.

## Messaging helpers

| Tool              | Purpose                                         |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Propagation nodes | Manage LXMF propagation nodes and sync          |
| Forwarder         | Configure LXMF forwarding rules between aliases |
| Sieve filters     | Pattern-based inbound message filtering (beta)  |
| Message blocklist | Block known unwanted content (beta)             |
| Paper message     | Create or ingest LXMF URIs and QR workflows     |
| Bots              | Run subprocess LXMF bots from templates         |

Bot templates include echo, note, and reminder starters. They use the bundled lxmfy package.

## Content and publishing

| Tool          | Purpose                               |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Mesh Server   | Host NomadNet-compatible page nodes   |
| Micron editor | Edit .mu pages locally              |
| Documentation | MeshChatX guides and Reticulum manual |

## Configuration editors

| Tool                    | Purpose                                 |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Reticulum config editor | Edit raw Reticulum configuration        |
| Repository server       | Host Python wheels for offline installs |

## Hardware and translation

| Tool          | Purpose                                              |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| RNode flasher | Flash or update RNode firmware                       |
| Translator    | Translate text via Argos Translate or LibreTranslate |

Translator calls respect **privacy mode**. When privacy mode blocks outbound HTTP, external translation endpoints are not contacted.

## Debugging

| Tool       | Purpose                       |
| ---------- | ----------------------------- |
| Debug logs | View backend debug log stream |

## Coming soon

The registry marks **RNS Tunnel** as coming soon. It does not have a route in the current release.

## Relay chat server

When rrc_enabled is on, you can run a local RRC hub from relay chat server settings. Hubs announce aspect rrc.hub. Client UI lives under **Relay chat** in the main navigation.

## Plugins

Installed plugins can add rows to **Tools** and **Navigation** through contribution manifests. Example bundled plugin: **Bug Reports** (com.meshchatx.mcx-bugs) for sending redacted debug logs to an mcx-bugs-v1 collector (or running a collector yourself).

Plugins are capability-gated, not fully open-ended: they cannot rewrite core MeshChatX. Supported packaged runtimes are **frontend JS** (Worker), optional **backend WASM** (wasmtime), and optional **backend Python** (backend.type: "python"). Install sources include ZIP archives and single-file **WASM bundles** with embedded plugin.json / files / optional RSG signature.

ZIP and WASM installs show a confirmation dialog with requested permissions, scanned/declared external HTTP URLs, signature status (unsigned / signed / trusted / invalid), and heuristic security findings. Invalid signatures hard-block install. You can deny individual grants and optionally trust a valid signer. After install, MeshChatX stores an integrity hash and auto-disables tampered plugins.

Optional **Sideband-compatible** plugins load flat *.py files from a configured directory when the master switch is enabled (danger confirm). They run in-process with full host access. Optional sibling filename.py.rsg signatures are verified over file bytes.

Sign packages with scripts/sign-plugin.py (sign|verify for -dir|-zip|-wasm|-py) using a Reticulum identity (rnid or in-process RNS.Identity). MeshChatX plugin signing uses signature file meshchatx.plugin.rsg and WASM custom sections meshchatx.plugin / meshchatx.files / meshchatx.signature.

Disable packaged plugins at startup with --disable-plugins if you need a minimal surface.
