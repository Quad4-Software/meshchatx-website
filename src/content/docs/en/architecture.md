MeshChatX is a fork of Reticulum MeshChat with LXST telephony, RRC relay chat, Nomad tooling, plugins, and a SQL backend without Peewee. The goals below shaped how the codebase is organized.

## Design goals

- Keep a local-first runtime that works on desktop, mobile, containers, and single-board computers.
- Preserve Reticulum and LXMF semantics while improving usability and operational tooling.
- Support multiple identities in one process without cross-identity data leakage.
- Keep the Python backend and Vue frontend independently testable.
- Run in constrained environments with predictable SQLite behaviour.

Mesh features should follow Reticulum post-IP design patterns: portable identity hashes, announces, store-and-forward, transport-agnostic APIs, and scarce payloads. See the [Zen of Reticulum](https://reticulum.network/manual/zen.html).

## Process overview

One Python process owns the web server, Reticulum stack, and all per-identity managers. The Vue frontend is static assets served from meshchatx/public/ after a Vite build.

```
ReticulumMeshChat (meshchat.py)
    |
    +-- HTTP package (src/backend/http/)
    |       +-- middleware + register_all_routes
    |       +-- routes/* (/api/v1/*, shell, static helpers)
    |       +-- ws/* (dispatch and handlers)
    +-- IdentityContext (per active identity)
    |       +-- SQLite via database layer
    |       +-- LXMRouter
    |       +-- TelephoneManager (LXST)
    |       +-- Domain managers (messages, map, docs, RRC, ...)
    +-- Shared Reticulum instance (~/.reticulum by default)
```

Optional **Electron** wraps the same backend binary and loads the UI from the local HTTPS server.

## Application shell

ReticulumMeshChat in meshchatx/meshchat.py is the orchestration layer. It wires HTTP via meshchatx/src/backend/http/, starts and stops identity contexts, wires crash recovery, and coordinates shared process concerns.

Path helpers live in meshchatx/src/path_utils.py, ssl_self_signed.py, and env_utils.py. meshchat.py re-exports them for compatibility.

## Identity-scoped context

IdentityContext in meshchatx/src/backend/identity_context.py encapsulates everything tied to one cryptographic identity:

- Storage under storage/identities/<identity_hash>/
- Identity-local SQLite database (schema version tracked in migrations)
- LXMF router state and propagation directories
- Manager instances for messages, announces, docs, maps, forwarding, bots, RRC, Nomad page nodes, and more

Switching identities tears down the old context and loads another. Global mutable state that could leak between identities is avoided by design.

## Destination aspects

Mesh peers are addressed by destination hash plus aspect. MeshChatX currently uses:

| Aspect              | Role                         |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| lxmf.delivery     | LXMF mail                    |
| lxmf.propagation  | Propagation node             |
| lxst.telephony    | LXST calls                   |
| nomadnetwork.node | NomadNet / Mesh Server pages |
| rrc.hub           | Relay Chat hub               |
| map-data-v1       | Published map overlay packs  |

map-data-v1 announce app_data is a short JSON label and file count. Catalog and file bytes travel over an RNS Link, not announce payloads or LXMF. The destination is created and announced only after at least one pack is published. Mesh announce stays a separate opt-in.

## Manager-centric domain logic

Feature behaviour lives in modules under meshchatx/src/backend/. Examples include message handling, announce trimming, documentation, maps, page nodes, telemetry, interfaces, forwarding aliases, and RN-specific tool handlers.

meshchat.py should stay focused on transport and lifecycle. Business rules belong in managers where they can be unit tested.

## Persistence

- **Engine:** SQLite with explicit SQL and migrations (no ORM).
- **Schema:** Versioned migrations run during startup and identity setup.
- **Backups:** Automatic and manual database backups under database-backups/.
- **Recovery:** --auto-recover, emergency mode, and Electron crash UI can restore from backups.

## HTTP API

Routes are registered through backend/http/register.py into aiohttp route tables
(still discoverable as @routes.<method> for contract scanners). Categories include:

- Application status and configuration
- Authentication and session management
- LXMF messaging and conversations
- Telephone and voicemail
- Interfaces and Reticulum configuration
- Nomad Network and page nodes
- RRC client and server
- Tools (ping, RNPath, RNCP, RNSH, translator, bots)
- Map overlays and map-data-v1 publish/discover
- Documentation and maintenance

The frontend uses fetch via apiClient.js with CSRF tokens on mutating requests.

## WebSockets

The UI connects to /ws for low-latency updates. Event types include new LXMF messages, identity switches, telephone state, RRC activity, Nomad download progress, RNCP transfers, and plugin events. Handlers are registered in wsEventRegistry.js and dispatched through wsEventBridge.js.

Audio calls can use /ws/telephone/audio for browser-side codec bridging.

## Security model

MeshChatX defaults toward secure local operation:

- HTTPS and WSS enabled by default.
- Self-signed certificates generated per identity when custom PEM files are absent.
- Optional HTTP basic authentication (--auth).
- Encrypted session cookies via aiohttp_session.
- CORS, CSP, and defensive middleware on HTTP responses.
- Access attempt logging with lockout when auth is enabled.

The project includes extensive automated tests around auth and sessions. Even so, exposing MeshChatX directly to the public internet is not recommended without additional hardening.

Password reset is available with --reset-password or MESHCHAT_RESET_PASSWORD=true, which clears the stored bcrypt hash so you can set a new password in the UI.

## Build and packaging

One source tree produces:

- Development runs via uv run python -m meshchatx.meshchat
- Python wheels with bundled public/ assets
- Container images (Alpine Dockerfile with standard/extra VARIANT, plus hardened Chainguard)
- Electron builds for Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Android APK via Chaquopy

Frontend build output always lands in meshchatx/public/ so runtime behaviour matches across targets.

## Reliability features

- Crash recovery integration in Electron and backend startup checks
- Database integrity verification
- Backup, restore, and snapshot APIs
- Explicit teardown when switching identities or shutting down forwarding resources
- Health and status endpoints suitable for container probes

## Extensibility

MeshChatX supports plugins with separate frontend and backend runtimes:

- **Contribution registries** under meshchatx/src/frontend/js/registries/ for navigation, tools, commands, settings, and WebSocket events.
- **Frontend plugins** run in dedicated Workers (PluginHost.js) with declarative UI slots.
- **Backend WASM plugins** run in wasmtime with fuel metering and capability-gated host functions.
- **Backend Python plugins** (backend.type: "python") run in-process with a permission-checked host (log, managers, storage, network flag).
- **WASM bundles** embed manifest/files/signature in custom sections and unpack on install.
- **Sideband-compatible loader** optionally execs flat *.py plugins with PLUGIN_COMMAND LXMF dispatch.
- **Security core** verifies RSG signatures, trusted publishers, integrity hashes, and heuristic findings.
- **HTTP API** under /api/v1/plugins/* and /api/v1/sideband-plugins/* for install, enable, invoke, trust, and Sideband config.

Practical extension paths today:

- Plugin manifests with contributes and permissions blocks
- New API routes and manager modules
- Frontend pages wired through registries
- New settings via ConfigManager and CLI or environment variables
- Database schema changes through migrations
- Generic RNS Link transport over WebSocket (rns.link.*) for external consoles and plugins (see [RNS Link API](rns-link-api))

Granted plugin manager capabilities include destinationPath.read, debugLog.read, bugReport.*, and rnsLink.open / identify / request / send / close. Hooks include announce.received and rns.link.event. Storage (storage:isolated) and outbound HTTP (network:fetch) are also grantable. The installation preview scans plugin files for external URLs and stores the user-selected grant subset.

When adding features, prefer identity-scoped state, explicit migrations, endpoint tests, and narrowly declared plugin permissions.

## NomadNet and Mesh Server

The Nomad browser and Mesh Server (page nodes) share a rendering pipeline for Micron, Markdown, plain text, and sanitised HTML. Authoring rules are documented in **NomadNet page formats**.
